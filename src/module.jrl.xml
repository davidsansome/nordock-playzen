                                <value><![CDATA[1. InGame The DM is ALWAYS Right
No matter what your interpretation of the rules tells you, the DMs have the final word.
Do not "shout" your objections to their decisions ingame. 
If you do not agree with a ruling, or feel a DM has mistreated you, use the DM channel to discuss this with them directly, post your question or comments in the forums.
Do not argue with a DM. 
It is up to the DMs judgement whether you are breaking a rule.

2. Foul Language Should be limited, especially in the daytime (pre 9pm GMT)
For cases where you are unsure if something is considered to be "foul language" refer to rule #1.
If you are still not sure, then do not use the word(s) you are considering.

3. Be Considerate of Others

A. The shout channel is a useful tool, however please limit the use to necessity. If you do need to use the shout channel please do so, but give someone time (a minimum of 3 minutes) to respond to you via 'Tell' before issuing more shouts.

B. Do not loot anything that you did not kill... the final blow is not always dealt by the person who actually killed the beast.

C. When in a group, finish the fight before searching the corpses... your party member(s) probably need your help and the loot is not going anywhere.

D. If you run from a monster, try not to lead it onto unsuspecting players. If this does happen, help them defeat the beast (they maybe weaker than you)... be sure to apologize and thank them for the aid.

E. Avoid camping an Area
Camping is defined as staying in one area waiting for creatures to respawn and by doing so denying other players of that area's use. This is a RolePlaying server. It is not a powerleveling server. If you only strive for level 20 and "uber gear" perhaps you would be happier elsewhere.

F. If somebody is harassing you, or doing "tells" to you that you find insulting take a screen pic (print screen button = pic will be in NWN folder as a TGA file) and give it to a DM. 
Do not "take matters into your own hands".

4. Roleplay is Required
If you find that RolePlaying is not something you enjoy perhaps you would feel more comfortable in a server hosted under another Gamestyle.

5. Not All NPCs in the World of Nordock are Combatants
Do not kill NPCs unless they ask for a fight in their conversation, or unless they are a NPC Guard.]]></value>

1. The Arena
2. Both parties have consented
3. The Encounter is role played and there is an opportunity for the weaker character to back down
4. Once PvP is started it must be concluded in one way or another before either player disconnects. If your network connection fails, post an appology on the forums and arrange with the other player to have a rematch. Conclusion can mean that one PC runs for the hills and hides but that PC must leave the other PC 2 zones behind before it can be assumed that the encounter is over.

                                <value><![CDATA[Pick Pocketing (PP) is a special form of PvP and follows slightly different rules as asking "please can I steal from you?" is a bit silly. These rules are designed to make playing a rogue thief possible whilst being fair to other players. They apply to any creature you pick pocket that is not of a violent nature towards you prior to the act.

1. The 'victim' must not be rated effortless or easy. They should stand a chance.
2. You must set your victim to Hostile before you pickpocket him.
3. PP is considered an aggressive action and thus consent for agressive reactions.
4. Obviously never use a game engine exploit to steal, this is bannable.
5. Leave non-combatent NPC's alone. If they become combatent only because of a botched pp attempt you must not harm them or lead them out of their area.
6. If you are caught in the act it is likely someone will try to have revenge, you may run or defend yourself, you may fight back, you may not log out until you are 2 zones clear of them. The fugue is considered 2 zones clear ;)
Be warned, this kind of action could lead to players putting a bounty on your head.

                                <value><![CDATA[1. A bounty may be set by any character on any character. The bounty can be for the death, capture or return of property. The setting of the bounty must be in character.

2. On accepting the bounty the acceptance and the motivation to accept must be posted on the Bulletin Board for all to see.  A DM may cancel the acceptance if he feels it has been made out of character.  The hunter must set themselves to 'dislike' the other hunted whenever they see they are on the server.. The bounty is then considered live for a period of one month. At the end of this month (real month not game month) the bounty hunter must contact the client and if the offer is still open may repost that he is continuing his quest. The DM may rule that the bounty is out of date, if you find your bounty removed from the board then its over. You are not permitted to take the same bounty more than three (3) times.

3. At the time of the encounter the following rules must be observed.
>a. both players are consdered to have consented to pvp, provided the rules previously have been followed thus far. So either may attack the other at any time. 
>b. Neither player must intentionally disconnect from the server until there is a 2 zone gap between them. 
>c. Any encounter must be resolved prior to disconnect either by escape, submision or death.

4. If you are disconnected unintentionally (isp problems) it is your responsibility to make efforts to contact the other player, via forums for example and arrange a rematch or offer an acceptable explanation.

5. If the hunter or hunted is killed then the bounty is over. The hunter may collect the head from the hunted's body in order to prove his success. If the hunter is killed he has to repost his acceptance of the bounty should he want to continue.

6. Collection. The head of the dead player is considered proof of a kill. If a player can prove they have completed the required bounty and the character does not wish to pay, this is considered an agressive act. This is also not something an honourable character would do. If they cannot prove that they have completed the bounty then refusal to pay is NOT considered an aggressive act.

7. Hiding in town. You are not permitted to *hide* in a non-pvp area to escape a bounty hunter. A DM will be quite within his rights to alter your faction and send 'the law' after you should you try this. That is not to say he will do this it will depend on the particular situation.]]></value>

In addition, any player caught exploiting any "bugs" in the game or in the server scripts will be dealt with accordingly. 
If you find a "bug", "exploit", or player using any of the above please report them to a DM via the forums so they may be dealt with for the betterment of the entire server.

Please note, the DM's consider logging out to avoid death an exploit. please ensure that when you log out there are no monsters in the immediate vicinity, no players in line of sight and that any PvP that you have been involved in is 'resolved'.

Twinking is the act of handing powerful magic down from your high level character to your low level character. Twinking is considered an exploit. You *are* allowed to transfer these items by selling them to your lower level characters at the value a shopkeeper places on them. Stay with the spirit of these rules and avoid 'circular twinking'. If you take the piss a dm will strip the items from both your characters and hit the kill button, possibly several times. ;-)
Please do not report them to a character played by someone who is also a dm. We like to play too.]]></value>

For some time, a band of kobolds has been camping in the Benzor Swamp. This in itself is only a minor irritation, but a few weeks ago...events took a darker turn.
Hordes of kobolds poured out of the swamp. They were followed by lizard folk and the lot of them threw themselves against the city's defenses. Fortunately, a brave band of adventurers was able to stem the tide. I sent this band into the swamp to investigate the mystery behind the attack.
It turns out that a trio of black dragons were behind the assault. The heroes confronted and slew the beasts, but not before the foul beasts bragged about an excavation that was almost complete. I fear that the darkness that I now sense close to Benzor is an ancient evil that these lizard creatures have awoken.
So you and any brave companions you can find are to journey into the swamp area...go north out of the city and find the path towards the swamps to the east, behind the old quarry. Find out the source of the evil and I shall reward you greatly.]]></value>
