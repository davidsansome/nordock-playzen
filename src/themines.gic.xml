Switches
--------------

MSP_
Tells the mining spawn control object that this waypoint is a spawn point.

MST# - Miniumum Spawn Time in # seconds 
           MST10 makes min spawn 10 seconds
XST# - Maximum Spawn Time in # seconds

Spawn times are between the min and max.  If they are the same then it always spawns in that time.  Set 

both to 0 for instant respawn and set MST higher than XST if you never want it to respawn.

FRS# - Force a refresh spawn every # seconds
       The # must be greater than 0.

CLU# - Creates a cluster of rocks around the waypoint
             where # is the number of rocks

CRS  - Only respawn when the entire cluster is destroyed

DST# - When creating a cluster, this determines the
            max distance away in meters to create the rocks

DUR# - Durability of the rock 
          DUR100 gives the rock 100 points of durability
          Set this to 0 to make it unbreakable.
          Place this immediately following an ore/gem switch 
          to have different durabilities for the veins or place before
          all ore/vein switches to affect them all.

Ore & Gem Switches
------------------
You may place any many of these as you want.  If the # percentages do not add up
to 100, then the remaining chance is for an unmineable rock.  If the total exceeds 100, 
then only the ones that come first that total 100 will have a chance to be created.  

Ore Switches
COP# - Produces a copper vein some # % of the time
          COP20 produces a copper vein 20% of the time
BRO# - Produces a bronze vein
IRO# - Produces an iron vein
SIL# - Produces a silver vein
GOL# - Produces a gold vein
BLA# - Produces a shadow vein
SYE# - Produces a syenite vein
RUB# - Produces a rubicite vein
VER# - Produces a verdicite vein
MIT# - Produces a mithral vein
ADA# - Produces an adamantine vein
MYR# - Produces a myrkandite vein

Gem Switches
MAL# - Produces a malachite vein some # % of the time
          MAL20 produces a malachite vein 20% of the time
AMY# - Produces an amethyst vein
JDE# - Produces a jade vein
LAZ# - Produces a lapis lazuli vein
TRQ# - Produces a turquoise vein
OPL# - Produces an opal vein
OYX# - Produces an onyx vein
PRL# - Produces a pearl vein
SAP# - Produces a sapphire vein
BSP# - Produces a black sapphire vein
FOP# - Produces a fire opal vein
RBY# - Produces a ruby vein
EME# - Produces an emerald vein
DIA# - Produces a myrkandite vein

If you do not put in certain switches, then default values will be used.  These can be found in the
ats_config file.

Now for an example: The name field MSP_MS300_XST600_DUR50_CLU5_DST2_OPL20_COP60_IRO20_DUR25
would create a spawn point with a cluster of size 5 that had a 20% chance to spawn a opal vein with 

durability 50, a 60% chance to spawn a copper vein with durability 50, and a 25% chance to spawn an iron 

vein with durability 25.  All these veins would be within 2 meters of the spawn point and would respawn 

anywhere between 300 and 600 seconds.
