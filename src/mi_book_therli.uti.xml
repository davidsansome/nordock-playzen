"The private journals of Therli Thiorl, adventurer extraordinaire.

It lives.  It moves all around me, I can feel the energy absorbing my body, twisting it inside.  I feel strong and weak at the same time.  Something has happened... a sudden surge of energy gulfed over the island, followed by a wave of some kind of despair. It's difficult to describe, but a deep sadness has taken over the land.  My party want to get off this island as quickly as possible and maybe they're right.  The beast or thing that took our rogue didn't look natural at all.  We don't want to meddle with gods."]]></value>
